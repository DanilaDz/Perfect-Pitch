# Perfect-Chord
Perfect Chord is a game/program made in Pygame using Python that I created to test out the results of a research study. The game is based on a research study called "A longitudinal study of the process of acquiring absolute pitch: A practical report of training with the â€˜chord identification method'" by Ayako Sakakibara. I used the ideas and conclusions from the study to replicate the results but with an automated program instead of a physical presence. The program has 8 levels that increasingly get harder and the person has to connect the chord given to the color (as stated in the study). I was able to test this program out on a child participant and after a few months of continuous practice, he was able to get every single chord progression correct, just from listening, that I have made. The project is technically complete but there are many other aspects that can be added to improve the learning and further progress the absolute pitch of participants. There could be potential plans to expand sometime.
